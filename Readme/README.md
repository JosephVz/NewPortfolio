# <NewPortfolio>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

- My motivation is to have a place where I can show everything I've done in one place so i can look back upon my projects and modules to see what I can do better.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

- I built this project to gauge where my skill level is and im not super happy with this project which really motivates me to learn more about each and every subject so I can apply this into the real life world.

- What problem does it solve?

- This solves the problem of having something to show employers what I can really do. The projects inside of the application as well as the application itself show where my skills are placed at and what exactly I should be focusing on.

- What did you learn?

- I learned that I have a lot left to improve on. Im not happy with the outcome on this work and this shows me how much more time I need to put into learning about these topics. I plan to update this portfolio once out of bootcamp in order to brush up on some skills that I have learned.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
